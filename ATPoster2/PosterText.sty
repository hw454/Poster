\begin{alertblock}{Why use the method?}
\blockcolours
\begin{itemize}
\item When the wavelength is small this method is much faster than numerical \pde methods which require a very small mesh size.
\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}

%-------------- Third Block
\newcommand{\MathematicalMotivation}{
\begin{block}{Mathematical motivation}
\setbeamercolor{item}{fg=\blockitem}
\captionsetup[figure]{labelfont={color=\blockcaption}}
\begin{itemize}
\item A time-independent model for wave propagation is the 
\textbf{Helmholtz equation}:
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \phi(x)+{\underbrace{k}_{\substack{\text{Wave} \\ \text{number}}}}^2 \phi(x)=0.
\end{equation}
\item Where $k$ is the wave number given by $$k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}=\frac{2 \pi f}{c}, $$ $f$ is the frequency of the wave, and $c$ the velocity.
\item Assuming that $\phi(x)$ can be written as a function of the path $S(x)$ in the form $\phi=u(x)e^{i k S(x)}$ then $u$ satisfies,
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{k^2}\nabla^2 u - u \left( |\nabla S|^2-1 \right)=0
\end{equation} 
Since $k \gg 1$, $S(x)$ satisfies the \textbf{Eikonal Equation}:
\begin{equation}
{|\nabla S|}^2=1 \Rightarrow |\nabla S|=1
\end{equation}
The constant gradient means that a ray is a valid approximation for the wave propagation when $k\gg 1$.
\end{itemize}

%-------------- Second Block
\newcommand{\application}{
\begin{alertblock}{Applications}
\alertblockcolours
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Small wavelength propagation} can be used to model radio propagation in cities, and wifi propagation in the home. 
\item Developments in technologies have resulted in an increased demand for \textbf{high frequency wifi propagation models}. 
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=\singlefigurewidth]{Room} 
\caption{Template domestic environment projected into two dimensions \label{fig::temproom}}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}
\item Figure \eqref{fig::temproom} gives an example simulated environment.
\item To get an idea of the coverage around the environment the method of geometric optics can be used.
\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}
}



%-------------- Fourth Block
\newcommand{\resultsblock}{
\begin{alertblock}{Trajectory approximations}
\alertblockcolours
\begin{itemize}
\item
The method of geometric optics can be applied to the problem of \textbf{wifi propagation}. For simplicity it is assumed that the antenna propagates uniformly and the domain is modelled in \textbf{two dimensions}.
\uniformpropagation
 \item Using Hewett's argument in \cite{hewett2010sound} since the Rayleigh distance is much larger than the spatial distance it is valid to \textbf{ignore diffraction effects}. 
 \item Objects are all also given the same reflection coefficient and refraction is ignored---this is valid since the loss is very high.
 \item Phase change has also been ignored in this model.
\raysroom
\item In Figure \eqref{fig::rayroom} the method of geometric optics has been applied to Figure \eqref{fig::temproom} to visualise the coverage. This has been applied to two different source locations.
\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}
}

%-------------- Fifth Block
\newcommand{\resultssecondblock}{
\begin{block}{Wifi coverage - Ignoring phase}
\blockcolours
\begin{itemize}
\item It is also important to get an idea of the power of the \textbf{wifi coverage}. 
\item This is calculated along the rays taking into account the \textbf{attenuation in free space} and the \textbf{reduction at the reflections}. 
\item The loss resulting from the distance travelled is calculated using the \textbf{Friis transmission formula}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn::FriisTransmissFormula}
\frac{u_r}{u_t}=G_a G_b \left( \frac{\lambda}{4 \pi r} \right)^2, \hspace{0.1\linewidth}\cite{aragon2008antennas}
\end{equation} 
where $u_r$, $u_t$ give the power at the receiver and transmitter relatively. The gain for the antenna's $G_a$ and $G_b$ are taken to be $1$. 
\item Figure \ref{fig::signalcoverage} shows the signal power for two \textbf{different transmitter locations}.
\Heatmap
%\item A problem with this visualisation is that \textbf{very extreme low values makes the fairly low values look better}. Practically any value below $30$ dBm is unusable. Similarly for the \textbf{extreme high values}. 
%\item To account for this the values are \textbf{bounded} within their useful range of $[30,120]$ dBm. The resulting coverage is then found.
%\HeatmapBounded
